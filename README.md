CoronaPunk
==========

A basic little port from flashpunk to Corona for programers who are familiarized with flashpunk entities managment.

This version doesn't pretend to be a full flashpunk port, due the graphics capabilities Corona has internally,
so its merely an alternative way using OOP and game entities in Lua.
