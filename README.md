CoronaPunk
==========

A basic little port from flashpunk to Corona for programers who are familiarized with flashpunk entities managment.

This version doesn't pretend to be a full flashpunk port, due the graphics capabilities Corona has internally,
so its merely an alternative way using OOP and game entities in Lua.

It has been realized using IntelliJ IDEA 12 CE and using tutorials from:

- http://karnakgames.com/wp/2013/02/free-ide-for-corona-sdk-with-autocompletion-and-parameter-info/ 
  if your programming with Mac.

- http://producerism.com/blog/how-to-develop-in-corona-sdk-on-windows/ 
  if your programming with Windows.

So its recommended that first create an empty Lua project in this IDE and then clone this repository inside that project.
